{"name":"Vagrant Box Generator for OpenStack's DevStack","tagline":"","body":"## Usage\r\n\r\nTo generate a brand new Vagrant box, simply run:\r\n\r\n    ./script/build\r\n\r\nand go take a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use an alternate provider (such as VMware Fusion), simply\r\nprovide the provider name like so:\r\n\r\n    ./script/build vmware_fusion\r\n\r\n## Box Details\r\n\r\n* The operating system is Ubuntu 12.04\r\n* The generated box will have a pre-determined private IP address\r\n  of **172.16.100.10**. This helps to expose all the entire virtual machine\r\n  ports to your workstation\r\n* The fixed address range for Nova instances\r\n  is **172.16.100.129** - **172.16.100.254**\r\n* The floating address range for Nova instances\r\n  is **172.16.100.65** - **172.16.100.126**\r\n* The default password for the admin user, mysql, rabbit, etc. is `\"stack\"`\r\n* The `\"default\"` security group has ICMP and SSH traffic enabled by default\r\n* Offline mode will be enabled after initial build from setting `OFFLINE=True`\r\n* Reclone mode is disabled by default from setting `RECLONE=no`\r\n* Placing a `local.sh` file (which is executable) in the same directory as your\r\n  project Vagrantfile allows you to further customize the devstack setup.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n### Development Setup\r\n\r\nSetting up for development should *only* require the following:\r\n\r\n    git clone <git_url>\r\n    cd <repo-dir>\r\n    ./script/bootstrap\r\n\r\n### Refreshing/Updating Local Copy\r\n\r\nSimiliar to the **Development Setup**:\r\n\r\n    git pull\r\n    ./script/bootstrap\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"development\"></a> Development\r\n\r\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\r\n* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\r\n\r\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.\r\nIdeally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repo\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"authors\"></a> Authors\r\n\r\nCreated and maintained by [Fletcher Nichol][fnichol] (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\r\n\r\n[fnichol]:      https://github.com/fnichol\r\n[repo]:         https://github.com/fnichol/devstack-vagrant-basebox\r\n[issues]:       https://github.com/fnichol/devstack-vagrant-basebox/issues\r\n[contributors]: https://github.com/fnichol/devstack-vagrant-basebox/contributors\r\n","google":"UA-29670723-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
